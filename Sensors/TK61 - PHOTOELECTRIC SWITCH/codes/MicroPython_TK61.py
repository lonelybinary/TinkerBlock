TK61-PHOTOELECTRIC SWITCH - Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Example

Description:
This script demonstrates how to use the TK61-PHOTOELECTRIC SWITCH module to control LED
- LED on when object blocks light, LED off when no object detected

Wiring:
Change the pin definition in code to match your wiring.

Usage:
1. Save this script to Raspberry Pi Pico 2
2. Run the script and check terminal output
3. Block sensor light and observe LED state
