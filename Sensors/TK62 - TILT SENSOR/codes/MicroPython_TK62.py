TK62-TILT SENSOR - Raspberry Pi Pico 2 Example

Description:
This script demonstrates how to use the TK62-TILT SENSOR module to control LED
- LED on when tilt detected, LED off when level

Wiring:
Change the pin definition in code to match your wiring.

Usage:
1. Save this script to Raspberry Pi Pico 2
2. Run the script and check terminal output
3. Tilt the sensor module and observe LED state

# Create pin objects
tilt = Pin(TILT_PIN, Pin.IN)   # Set tilt sensor pin as input (to read detection state)

    # Read tilt sensor state

    # Control LED based on detection state
    if tiltState == 1:
